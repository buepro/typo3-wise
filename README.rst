========================
TYPO3 extension ``wise``
========================

Use this extension to register and process credit transactions from a wise
account. With the provided event handler or a cron job the latest credit
transactions can be automatically pulled into your TYPO3 instance. Once new
credit transactions have been added an event for further processing is
dispatched.
